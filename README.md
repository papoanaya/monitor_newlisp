MONITOR_NEWLISP
============
Motivation
----------

Needed a set of newlisp scripts to monitor Linux systems 
that do not take a lot of  resources. 

This includes:

* bb-mysql: Set of xymon mysql monitoring scripts in newlisp.
* bb-wx: Newlisp script that collects data from the National Weather 
Service for xymon.
* bb-zebra: Newlisp script to collect data from a trendnet router.
* bb-lighttp: Newlisp script to collect data from lighttpd using the
  server-status address. 
* dzen2: Newlisp script to work with dzen2.
* misc: Miscellaneous scripts used for monitoring systems.
