Motivation
----------

Needed a set of scripts to monitor systems that do not take a lot of 
resources and does not flicker. Dzen2 fit the bill for this purposes. 
Included is a list of scripts that I developed for monitor Linux
systems.

Known Issues
------------

* Very raw scripts that need to be made more generic.

Bugs
----

More bugs than a wasp's nest.

Installation

TBD Scripts need to be productize and made more generic. 
Until then, no installation intructions will be provided.
