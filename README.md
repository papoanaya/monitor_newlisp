MONITOR_NEWLISP
============
Motivation
----------

Needed a set of newlisp scripts to monitor Linux systems 
that do not take a lot of  resources. 

This includes:

* DZen Monitoring Scripts
* Xymon/BigBrother/Hobbit Monitoring Scripts

Known Issues
------------

* Very raw scripts that need to be made more generic.

Bugs
----

More bugs than a wasp's nest.

Installation
------------

TBD Scripts need to be productize and made more generic. 
Until then, no installation intructions will be provided.
