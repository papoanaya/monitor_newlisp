Misc
============

Motivation
----------

Scripts written in newlisp for different purposes. 
It includes:

* myfree.lsp - "free" command in newlisp, needed
to monitor memory in some ARM systems.
* wx.nlsp - Trial script to interface to the 
National Weather Service website.
* websequencediagram.lsp - Websequence diagram
trial script. 

Known Issues
------------

* Very raw scripts that need to be made more generic.

Installation
------------

Not applicable, these are just sample scripts.
myfree.lsp only needs to have newlisp available
and made executable. By running it, it will
show the available memory on a Linux system.
