Big Brother/Xymon Skeleton Sample for Newlisp
=============================================
Sample xymon scripts in newlisp

Motivation
----------

Needed to have a basic squeleton sample for big brother monitoring to
keep around when I needed to create new monitoring scripts. The following 
scripts are included:
* bb.nlsp - Client Xymon Script
* bb-svr.nlsp - Server Xymon Script
* weather.nlsp - RRD sample script

Installation
------------

None, these are sample scripts and only useful for developers
that are familiar with xymon, hobbit or big brother, and
newlisp.  If you are not a developer, these have
limited value. In code documentation explains what each of
the code components do.
