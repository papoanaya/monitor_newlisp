bb-mysqlstat
============
MySQL Monitor scripts written in newLISP to be used in Big Brother
or Xymon installations. 

Motivation
----------
Although most of the big brother/xymon scripts are written in perl
I prefer to use newlisp. In this directory there are scripts to monitor
mysql databases with graphic generation of slow queries and threads.

These are client side scripts. 

Installation
------------
Work in progress
